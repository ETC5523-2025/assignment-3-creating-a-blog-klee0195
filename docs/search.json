    "text": "Solutions from accessible data\nA recent study by Kermorvant et al.¬†(2023) points to a promising direction. Instead of focusing solely on nitrate sensors, they leveraged data from much more common and low-cost water quality sensors, including water level, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductance, and temperature. These are already well-established and widely deployed sensors. The data were collected every 15 minutes from three different watersheds in the United States.\nThe team used a Generalised Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) (a combination of the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and ARIMA) to analyse the complicated nonlinear relationships between nitrate and these less expensive variables. The results were impressive: Their model explained 99% of the variation in nitrate concentrations at all three sites.\nHowever, the story does not end there. Although the same set of variables is used, their importance varies by location (see Table¬†1).\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Nitrate characteristics and key variables at three sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\nClimate zone\nNitrate characteristics\nMain controlling variables\n\n\n\n\nArikaree\nSemi-arid\nHighly variable nitrate (median = 5.5 ŒºM)\nNo dominant variable; water temperature most important but &lt;5% deviance; temporal autocorrelation critical (25% deviance)\n\n\nCaribou\nSubarctic\nStable, low nitrate (median = 28.4 ŒºM)\nSpecific conductance most important (10% deviance); temporal autocorrelation moderate (17% deviance)\n\n\nLewis Run\nTemperate\nHigh, highly variable nitrate (median = 192 ŒºM)\nAll variables important; specific conductance highest (&gt;15%), others 11-14% each\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach river has its own ‚Äústory.‚Äù The Arikaree River has a wide range of nitrate concentrations, but no single factor dominates. The Caribou River, with low and stable nitrate concentrations, is primarily influenced by conductivity. Meanwhile, at Lewis Run, a heavily urbanised area, all factors contribute significantly to the nitrate prediction. This shows the flexibility of the model to adapt to different local conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Variable importance, as the percentage of the total GAMM deviance, for statistically significant covariates (p &lt; 0.001), by study site. Total deviance explained by each GAMM was 99% for all three sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure¬†1, the importance of water quality variables in explaining nitrate varied significantly between watersheds. In Arikaree, the most important variable was water temperature but it also explained &lt; 5% of the variance, while the ARIMA component contributed up to 25% of the variance. In contrast, at Lewis Run, all variables were significant with specific conductance being the most important (&gt; 15%) and other variables contributing 11‚Äì14%, corresponding to GAM explaining up to 85% of the variance. Caribou had a more stable model, with GAM explaining 83% of the variance and specific conductance (~10%) being the dominant variable, while turbidity was the least important.\nIn short, the correlation between water quality parameters and nitrate concentrations is the basis for these accurate predictions. It means that we can monitor nitrate concentrations using more common and cheaper water quality sensors."

    "text": "A promising future\nThis study opens a new era for nitrate monitoring. Instead of relying on a few expensive nitrate sensors, managers can deploy a widespread network of lower-cost sensors for indirect and extremely effective monitoring. As the study by Kermorvant et al.¬†(2023) concluded, this approach ‚Äúopens up a more efficient and cost-effective way to monitor nitrate.‚Äù\nIn summary, the key findings are:\nHigh feasibility: A set of common water quality variables can predict nitrate concentrations with up to 99% accuracy.\nFlexibility: The GAMM statistical model is adaptable to different natural conditions of each watersheds.\nCost-effectiveness: This is a revolutionary solution, significantly reducing initial investment and operating costs, allowing for large-scale monitoring.\nThe cost of addressing nitrate problems in water sources is very expensive. In addition to the expensive measurement costs already mentioned and analysed, the cost of treating the water to remove nitrate is also very high. This result can significantly reduce the cost burden of nitrate concern. In other words, this approach not only helps to protect our rivers more effectively but also optimises the budget, bringing double benefits to environmental protection and resource management."
