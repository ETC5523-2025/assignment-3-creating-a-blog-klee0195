Welcome to my first website ever! ðŸ¥°

I am a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University.

With a background in finance and econometrics from my undergraduate studies, I bring an adventurous, challenge-seeking spirit and a strong desire to continue my academic journey at Monash. Through this program, I aim to strengthen my ability to explore data and uncover the stories it tells. These are skills that aligns and resonates with the analytical foundation from my bachelor studies.

This website not only showcases my work for [Assignment 3 of ETC5523: Communicating with Data](https://cwd.numbat.space/assignments/assignment-3.html) but also represents the first website I have ever created. I believe that taking the first step is already half the journey to success, so I am genuinely excited about the skills and experiences I will gain through this project.
